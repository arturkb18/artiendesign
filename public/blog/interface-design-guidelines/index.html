            <article class="entry-content">
                <p>Creating a new app or website can be a lot of fun. You think about the concept, research different design approaches and let your creativity take charge. When your creation is complete, you look at it and say, ‘I nailed it!’ But, did you? Just because you might have a killer design for your product, it doesn’t mean that it will be used by the same form by anyone. Therefore, you need to consider some interface design guidelines while working on your project.</p>

<p>But one might ask, ‘What are the interface design guidelines?’ According to Jakob Nielsen, a renowned web usability consultant, and Rolf Molich, a prominent usability expert, there are 10 rules of thumb to creating a great user interface design. You might be thinking now, ‘Cool, here comes a boring, lengthy list to read through that will take me forever to finish.’ Well, I’ll definitely list them all here, but I’ll try to make it as simple and as interesting as possible. By the end of the article, I’ll use my e-commerce website project I created during my Advance Graphic Design course, at Langara College, to illustrate some uses of the interface design guidelines.</p>

<p>So, are you still with me? Nice, let’s get started. Here are the guidelines:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Visibility of system status: your users should always be aware of what is going on regarding the system operations. Add a progress bar, say in which step your user is to complete one action. Please, let him know what is going on!</p></li>

<li><p>Match between system and the real world: mirror the language and concepts users find in the real world into your design. Does your website have a search bar? Use a magnifier glass to represent it. Yes, it is that simple.</p></li>

<li><p>User control and freedom: let your user in control to go back or forth, undo or redo one action. We, as users, make mistakes or want to revisit some information all the time. So, having a back button really helps!</p></li>

<li><p>Consistency and standards: all your interface elements should always be presented the same way. Be consistent with your typography, colors, elements positioning and so on. The slightest change from one screen to another can make your user very frustrated.</p></li>

<li><p>Error prevention: create a design that minimize user’s mistakes. Use clear and direct messages when requesting an action from your user. Using dialogue boxes to confirm if the user really wants to spend $1000 on Candy Crush lives is always a good idea.</p></li>

<li><p>Recognition rather than recall: minimize cognitive memory load from your user. We, as users, have a hard time trying to remember the order number for that parcel that has never arrived. Keep task-relevant information within the display while users explore the interface.</p></li>

<li><p>Flexibility and efficiency of use: as the users get used to your product, frequent actions can be achieved faster and easily. Therefore, always allow your user to customize or tailor the interface to suit their needs.</p></li>

<li><p>Aesthetic and minimalist design: keep your interface as simple as possible and present only relevant information to the user. People are already exposed to a lot of distractions while using your product, so don’t add anything to your design that can contribute to your users losing their focus.</p></li>

<li><p>Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors: use clear, meaningful messages to report any error to your users. We don’t have the faintest idea what error code 093JAHD29 means. Instead, explain what is going on and give direct instructions to recover from this error.</p></li>

<li><p>Help and documentation: yes, documentation can still be useful! Nowadays, we just want to run a piece of software and learn how to use it on the fly. However, users can still get lost and need some help. Make sure this help is easily located and written in a way that will guide your users to overcome the situation. There is nothing more frustrating than following instructions which do not solve your problem!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There you go! Those are the 10 golden rules to create a great interface for your user. As I mentioned early on the article, now I will present my e-commerce website project, so you can see those guidelines in use.</p>

<p>For this project, I created a fictitious online store called Sports Outfit, and, as you may have guessed, it sells sporting goods. One of the tasks was create a catalogue page. Here you can see the Men’s Catalogue page:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.artiendesign.com/images/catalogue.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This page introduces the following principles: minimalist design (only relevant information is displayed on the screen), visibility of system status (user has clear visual clues on which section of the website he is: Men’s catalogue &gt; Jerseys), and consistency and standards (color palette, typeface, header and footer remain the same throughout the entire website).</p>

<p>Up next is the product’s page:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.artiendesign.com/images/product_page.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you can see, the visual identity remains the same, and the way information is displayed is consistent with the catalogue page. The call to action button ADD TO CART has an orange color to draw user’s attention, creating a great contrast with the rest of the page.</p>

<p>Finally, we have the checkout page:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.artiendesign.com/images/checkout_page.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here, the visibility of system status plays a major role. When the user is going to buy something on line, he wants to know where in the process he to complete his order. So, right at the top, you can immediately see that you’ll have to go through 3 steps to place the order. Also, on the right side of the screen, there is a summary of the order and the list of products in your shopping cart. What is this rule about? You’re right, recognition rather than recall!</p>

<p>Instead of having to remember what items are on the shopping cart and how much the order is due, we leave this information available to the user all the time. It also prevents him from buying some undesirable item, as well as gives him the ability to edit the shopping cart in a fast and effective way. And this brings us another rule: efficiency of use.</p>

<p>Finally, another principle is present in every page I created for this project: match between system and real world. To represent the search bar, I used the magnifier glass, and the shopping cart is used as a metaphor for all the items that are on the user’s shopping list, just like as if he were in a grocery store.</p>

<p>By following these simple guidelines, you can still create great designs without leaving your user lost, confused and/or frustrated. It is a win-win situation and everybody is happy with the results.</p>

<p>And this is what I have to say about interface design guidelines. I hope you enjoyed this article and that you could learn at least one thing or two from it. Thank you for reading this and I hope to have you again for my next article, which will talk about typography.</p>
