A few years ago, I was watching the TV show The Middle, and in this episode Brick comes up with a podcast called “The FontCast”, and I laughed out loud with it. After all, what could be more boring an uninteresting than talking about fonts? At the time, I thought, ‘Who cares about fonts? They are just letters put together so we can read the words!’. That was way before I started studying design and I had no idea how fonts and typography can be a key factor for your final work.

But, after all, what is typography? Simply put, it is the art and technique of arranging type. And why is typography so important? Because it conserves the reader’s attention. And don’t make the mistake to think that by typography we are talking only about fonts. Fonts are, indeed, part of typography, but there are much more to it, as you’ll see throughout this article. 

To narrow down a little bit this subject, I will manly discuss how to use effective typography for websites. Otherwise, this article would last forever and you wouldn’t read it until the end.

When working with text on the web, text readability is key for keeping the user’s attention. If the typing is small, headings are gigantic and you use only system fonts like Times New Roman and Arial, it is very likely that your reader will be gone. Instead, increase the point size of your text, use headings that are smaller but still distinct, and choose better fonts. By applying these three simple typography rules, you will see a huge difference in your work.

Another good practice is to divide your text in sections. Nobody wants to read lengthy paragraphs that go on forever. Humans are lazy, so we always find a way to make the least effort possible. By breaking up your text, it will be easier for your readers to scan and find something that catches their attention.

Overuse of capital letters is another mistake a lot of people do when it comes to typography. It’s a common sense to believe that by WRITING EVERYTHING IN CAPITAL LETTERS WILL DRAG USER’S ATTENTION. Guess what? You lost your reader. It takes longer for us to recognize all caps letters, making the reading less fluid. So, the best advice is to use capital letters only for headings and taglines.

Just like all caps, sometimes we are tempted to use italic, cursive and decorative fonts to make our text more appealing and highlight something. And again, we fail to keep reader’s attention. An effective typography will use bold characters to add emphasis, and cursive and decorative fonts are never used because they are difficult to read and make your eyes tired.

Another typography aspect we need to consider is white space. Back to the dawn of the web, websites were piled with text, images, colors, sounds and flashing letters. It was pretty easy to have an epileptic seizure by that time. But, fortunately, this is no longer our reality and people finally learned that white space is our friend. You do not need to fill every pixel of the screen with information. By giving generous spacing among your content, your readers can focus on what really matters and give them some space to brief and rest their eyes.

Last but not least, always create a great contrast between foreground and background. And this is a rule of thumb for any medium. If you don’t create great contrast and text is difficult to read, people will give up and focus their attention to something else.

As you can see, there is a lot to consider about typography and I have only scratched the surface regarding this subject. But by following some simple principles, you can create a huge difference in your work and make it look much more professional.
